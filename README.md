# The Arcadian Constitution

**Version 1.0 â€“ Released May 2025**

Arcadia is a modern civic republic designed for a changing worldâ€”balancing guaranteed essentials, innovation, and structured citizen empowerment. This repository contains the official Arcadian Constitution, a modular and evolving framework for government built on three foundational pillars: structure, oversight, and renewal.

## What is Arcadia?

Arcadia is not a revolution. Itâ€™s an evolution.  
A system designed to:
- Guarantee essential needs for all citizens
- Support a dual economy (resource + currency)
- Empower citizens through direct civic engagement
- Maintain balance through structural oversight

Arcadia operates through three cooperative branches:
- **Foundation Corps** â€“ Ensures essential survival services
- **Civic Concord** â€“ Manages innovation, education, and market growth
- **Guardian Assembly** â€“ Safeguards constitutional integrity and national resilience

At its center is the **Civic Arbiter**, a nonpartisan role focused on balance, feasibility, and implementation of the Peopleâ€™s Mandate.
